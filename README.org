* S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Gamma Steam Deck Install Guide
This guide will get you up and running with STALKER Gamma on a Steam Deck.
The game runs pretty well - 60FPS most places, clear sky base down to ~40FPS. Totally playable.

I run it with steam+proton in this guide - it gives me much better performance than through lutris+wine

** What You'll Need
- A Steam Deck :^)
- A computer with Windows on it and around 90GB of space (virtual machines on Linux work - I'll show how to do it with virtualbox in this guide)
- Some way of transferring data to the Steam Deck.
  Multiple options here: SD Card; Upload to google drive then download on deck; copy to your phone, then plug it into the deck and copy the files...
- A few hours

** Getting the GAMMA files
1. Install Windows.
   If you're using virtualbox, then get the windows 10 ISO [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO][here]]
   Install it into a virtual machine, and make sure you give it around 90GB of space
2. On the windows box, download and install the software you're gonna need.
   - [[https://www.7-zip.org/][7-zip]], for extracting and compressing stuff
   - The latest 64-bit (x64) [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170][vc_redist]] (The one under the heading *Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022*)
   - [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=35][direct-x]], so you can run anomaly once to get the files all nice and right
3. Download the Anomaly and GAMMA files.
   - https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly Get the 1.5.1 and 1.5.1 to 1.5.2 update files.
   - Get the GAMMA files from the [[https://discord.com/invite/stalker-gamma][discord]]
4. Extract the files.
   1. Create folders *C:\anomaly* and *C:\​gamma*
   2. Extract the anomaly 1.5.1 archive into C:\anomaly, and then the 1.5.2 files over this
   3. Extract the gamma files into C:\​gamma, following the instructions on the discord
5. Run anomaly once
   Run the anomaly launcher, and then get into the main game's menu, then quit.
   This is to get files set up correctly
6. Run the gamma installer, following the discord's guide. This should download files properly.
7. Compress the files into an archive.
   Use 7-zip, and add the anomaly and gamma folders to an archive.

8. Get this archive from the virtual machine and onto your steam deck.
   A few ways to do this:
   - Enable shared folders on your VM, then copy it into the shared folder to get the archive on your host system
   - Upload the archive to google drive/other cloud service, then download it on your deck
   Whatever way you do it, get it onto your deck.
9. Extract the files from the archive onto your deck. I extracted them to ~/Games.
   You should end up with two folders in the folder you extract to: *anomaly* and *gamma*.
** Run GAMMA through proton
1. Add the mod organiser executable to steam
   Open up steam on the desktop, and add a non steam game.
   [[./images/Screenshot_20221026_105716.png]]
   Click on the browser option, and browse to your gamma folder.
   Change the file-type filter to "All Files", and then select ModOrganizer.exe
2. Set the mod organiser executable to run with proton.
   You should now have a bit in your library for mod organiser (I've renamed my shortcut to "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. GAMMA").
   Right click on it, and open the properties window.
   [[./images/Screenshot_20221026_110038.png]]
   Click the properties tab and tick the option "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatability tool"
   [[./images/Screenshot_20221026_110056.png]]
   Steam will now run mod organiser with proton, but before we can run gamma, we need to add some dlls to the proton prefix.
3. Install protontricks through the discover application. This lets your modify the proton prefix.
4. Open up protontricks and select Mod Organiser's shortcut to modify its prefix (remember I renamed mine to stalker gamma).
   [[./images/Screenshot_20221026_111103.png]]
   Choose menu options:
   - Select the default wineprefix
   - Install a Windows DLL or component
   - Select
     - d3dcompiler_43
     - d3dcompiler_47
     - d3dx10
     - d3dx11_43
     - d3dx9
     - d3dx9_43
     Then press "ok"
   You can then close the protontricks windows
5. Run your shortcut to mod organiser from steam. You should get an error since the path to anomaly will have changed.
   You need to direct mod organiser to the anomaly folder. The Z: drive contains your linux filesystem, so you should find it there.
6. Edit the link to the anomaly launcher executable. Direct the Binary option to the executable binary and set the start in option to
   the folder that the executable is in.

7. Try launching it. You should be able to start the game and load into the world, but you'll have issues with the shaders.
   If not - you've done something wrong, follow the guide again :^)
8. Remove reshade. Following the tips [[https://reshade.me/forum/general-discussion/4398-howto-uninstall-reshade][here]], open up the anomaly/bin folder and delete any of the dlls mentioned in that forum post
   and the reshade-shaders folder.
9. Disable shader mods.
   Following the steps for disabling shaders on the discord:
   Disable 
     - Screen Space Shaders - Ascii1457
     - Shaders Cumulative Pack for GAMMA

   Right click Beef's NVG addon, click "reinstall mod" and tick the following options: 
     - Beef's NVG 
     - Beef’s NVG - Patch ES
   Delete anomaly/appdata/shaders_cache folder
10. Launch the game. If you've followed all the instructions correctly, you should be able to play GAMMA.

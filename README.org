* S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Gamma Steam Deck Install Guide
This guide will get you up and running with STALKER Gamma on a Steam Deck.
The game runs pretty well - 60FPS most places, clear sky base down to ~40FPS. Totally playable.

** What You'll Need
- A Steam Deck :^)
- A computer with Windows on it and around 90GB of space (virtual machines on Linux work - I'll show how to do it with virtualbox in this guide)
- Some way of transferring data to the Steam Deck.
  Multiple options here: SD Card; Upload to google drive then download on deck; copy to your phone, then plug it into the deck and copy the files...
- A few hours

** Getting the GAMMA files
1. Install Windows.
   If you're using virtualbox, then get the windows 10 ISO [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO][here]]
   Install it into a virtual machine, and make sure you give it around 90GB of space
2. Install the software you're gonna need.

* S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Gamma Steam Deck Install Guide
This guide will get you up and running with STALKER Gamma on a Steam Deck.
The game runs pretty well - 60FPS most places, clear sky base down to ~40FPS. Totally playable.

** What You'll Need
- A Steam Deck :^)
- A computer with Windows on it and around 90GB of space (virtual machines on Linux work - I'll show how to do it with virtualbox in this guide)
- Some way of transferring data to the Steam Deck.
  Multiple options here: SD Card; Upload to google drive then download on deck; copy to your phone, then plug it into the deck and copy the files...
- A few hours

** Getting the GAMMA files
1. Install Windows.
   If you're using virtualbox, then get the windows 10 ISO [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO][here]]
   Install it into a virtual machine, and make sure you give it around 90GB of space
2. On the windows box, download and install the software you're gonna need.
   - [[https://www.7-zip.org/][7-zip]], for extracting and compressing stuff
   - The latest 64-bit (x64) [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170][vc_redist]] (The one under the heading *Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022*)
   - [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=35][direct-x]], so you can run anomaly once to get the files all nice and right
3. Download the Anomaly and GAMMA files.
   - https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly Get the 1.5.1 and 1.5.1 to 1.5.2 update files.
   - Get the GAMMA files from the [[https://discord.com/invite/stalker-gamma][discord]]
4. Extract the files.
   1. Create folders *C:\anomaly* and *C:\​gamma*
   2. Extract the anomaly 1.5.1 archive into C:\anomaly, and then the 1.5.2 files over this
   3. Extract the gamma files into C:\​gamma, following the instructions on the discord
5. Run anomaly once
   Run the anomaly launcher, and then get into the main game's menu, then quit.
   This is to get files set up correctly
6. Run the gamma installer, following the discord's guide. This should download files properly.
7. Compress the files into an archive.
   Use 7-zip, and add the anomaly and gamma folders to an archive.

8. Get this archive from the virtual machine and onto your steam deck.
   A few ways to do this:
   - Enable shared folders on your VM, then copy it into the shared folder to get the archive on your host system
   - Upload the archive to google drive/other cloud service, then download it on your deck
